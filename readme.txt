= MANAGE FACEBOOK TABS / APPS FROM WITHIN WORDPRESS. = 
Facebook app CMS, design and manage your facebook apps and tabs in Wordpress.

== Description ==

FACEBOOK TABS / APP CMS PLUGIN

* Want to build your Facebook “mini-website” with new tabs on your Facebook page navigation menu and content manage them from your website admin?
* Want more than just the Timeline to maximise your Likes and business enquiries?
* Would you like to showcase your products & services for your visitors to easily see?
* Maybe you want people to fill in a contact form on Facebook and receive their business enquiry or even stream your website blog onto a dedicated “blog” tab on your Facebook page? All this is possible and much more.


= FULL DESIGN & CONTENT MANAGEMENT OF YOUR TABS/APPS DIRECTLY FROM WORDPRESS =

If your website is Wordpress based simply install our FREE Wordpress plugin.

By installing the free plugin on your website you will be able to content manage 3 tabs / apps on your Facebook page. Any design / content changes you will do within Wordpress will reflect immediately on your Facebook page. You can simply design your Facebook tabs to your liking, and add any content (pictures, slideshows, videos, contact form etc) you like, much like you would do on any page of your website.

So, if you are able to manage your website from Wordpress, you’ll be able to manage your Facebook apps from it too.


= HOW IT WORKS =


* Simply download the free wordpress plugin and install it.
* On the left navigation menu bar of your wordpress admin, clcik on: "Facebook Tabs"
* Simply create your own design and content directly from your wordpress site, the same way as you would do for any page or post, and all your changes will automatically appear on your Facebook tabs.

You can use html and any coding you like (if you are skilled in coding) or simply use the visual editor to add your pictures, videos, text etc. You will be able to name your Facebook tabs as you like.

Manage 3 apps content instantly. Make changes within wordpress that are reflected immediately in your Facebook apps on your Facebook business page.

Simply create the design you like, add content as you see best (text, pictures, HTML code E.G: picture slideshows, videos etc. ) as you would do for any page of your website.

Want you blog posts as an App in Facebook? We have prepared this for you. All the necessary code is in place. Just make design changes you may like and your blog posts will display on your Facebook page in your new “Blog” app

Want a contact app on Facebook? We also created that for you. Simply add the contact form / html you like and it will become available to be an App on Facebook

= MANAGE PLUGIN =

- Click on the Facebook Tabs link in the left menu
- 3 Apps are ready for you to manage: About us (could be renamed to "services", "products" or anything you like), Blog (if you’d like to have a blog tab on your Facebook business page) and a Contact us tab (just design the page as you like, add your contact form etc, just as you would do on your wordpress contact page)
- The design on these pages is purely for reference. Delete it all if you like (be careful not to remove the blog code in the HTML if the blog app) and design the pages as you like, add the content you like etc.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `facebook-tab-editor` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Once activated, copy the files from '/wp-content/plugins/facebook-tabs-editor/files-to-copy' into your active Themes directory.
4. Click on the Facebook Tabs link in the left menu to manage the plugin.

== Frequently asked questions ==

**Does the plugin create the Facebook app on Facebook **

No, there is no way of doing that from wordpress. The Facebook app has to be created on Facebook. It is then easy to iframe your wordpress content into it.

**Can I delete all the design and code in the pages of the plugin and replace it with mine?**

Yes, absolutelly. Create whatever content you like.

**Will shortcodes from other plugins work?**

They should. There is no reason why they wouldn't. Use any HTML, markup, shortcodes etc you like and it should reflect perfectly in your Facebook apps.

== IMPORTANT INFORMATION: ==

This plugin is not “template based”. The aim is not to provide “ready to go designs for Facebook apps”. It is a plugin that will help SKILLED web designers to easily design App content for Facebook, and webmasters to manage that content easily and directly from within Worpress.

You need to create the Facebook app on Facebook that will display the content you are creating in Wordpress. If you are a Facebook app developer you will be able to create the apps on Facebook and stream these pages content easily.

If you are not a Facebook developer, we offer the Facebook development service for you, so your pages from this plugin become Apps on Facebook.
